***Does Financial Regulation Matter? Stock Volatility and the US 1933/34 Securities Acts***, joint with Sheng Li, Chenggang Xu.

Abstract: The U.S. Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 are the world's first public laws of financial regulation at the national level. Subsequent financial regulations all over the world follow the principle -- mandatory disclosure of information -- embedded in these two laws. However, the effects of these laws to financial markets are still under debate since Stigler (1964). We show theoretically that the law's central theme, mandatory disclosure, can reduce stock volatility by making trade-based manipulation difficult. We then provide systematic empirical evidence that the Acts have substantially reduced individual firms' idiosyncratic volatility and market volatility of NYSE listed firms. We find that NYSE stocks' idiosyncratic volatility significantly reduced after their first registration with SEC. Moreover, if a NYSE firm voluntarily disclosed less financial items before the Act, its idiosyncratic volatility would generally reduce at least 4% more than a firm that voluntarily disclosed more information beforehand, suggesting mandatory disclosure requirement's effective impacts on information quality. Furthermore, after the enforcement of the Act, NYSE stocks' idiosyncratic volatility dropped significantly more than that of OTC stocks, which were outside the scope of the Act. Also, market volatility significantly declined after the enforcement of both Acts. In addition, we show that even when we treat the existence and the dates of the volatility changes as unknown, statistically identified dates of structural changes are fully consistent with the enacting of the Acts.

***The Multitask Government Governance in a Regionally Decentralized Authoritarian Regime***, joint with Juan Lu, Chenggang Xu.

Abstract: China's government governance structure can be described as a ``Regionally Decentralized Authoritarianism'' model (Xu (2011)). In this model, the central government controls personnel affairs of local governors and incentivizes them by designing yardstick competitions of economic performances. However, unlike a private enterprise whose goal could be simply summarized as maximizing proÔ¨Åts, government agencies generally pursue multiple goals such as economic growth, health and education system construction, environment protection, etc. China's central government has been focusing excessively on the target of promoting economic growth but in recent years, the multitask nature of government has become increasingly prominent, creating serious problems in the existing governance model. By extending the Holmstrom and Milgrom (1991) multitask principal-agent model to a multitask-multiagent model, we explain under which conditions yardstick competition would fail in motivating local officials, and show that the optimal contract generated under a hierarchical government structure is not capable of solving these problems. The empirical findings further support our claims in the theoretical model.
