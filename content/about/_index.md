## About me

Hi, I'm ZHAO Bo, an assistant professor at School of Finance, Nankai University. I have a bachelor's degree on computational mathematics (Nanjing University), a master's degree on financial engineering (Xiamen University), and a PhD on economics (University of Hong Kong).

I am very interested in Political Economy, Law and Economics and Quantitative Finance. I teach econometrics, risk management and quantitative investment at Nankai. I love basketball (I am very proud that I had the fortune (or age🤓) of watching MJ playing live on TV) and I play a little piano. My email is zhaobo@nankai.edu.cn
